I'll modify the implementation to focus on GitLab integration that works well on Azure AKS, removing the AAD authentication since it's already implemented in your environment.This implementation is optimized for Azure AKS deployment with the following key features:

## AKS-Specific Optimizations:

**1. Token Management:**
- Supports multiple token sources (environment variables, Kubernetes secrets)
- Reads from `/etc/secrets/` mount path (standard AKS secret mounting)
- Fallback to build-time environment variables

**2. Network Resilience:**
- Built-in retry logic for network failures
- Configurable timeouts suitable for AKS networking
- Health check endpoint for monitoring

**3. Configuration Management:**
- Externalized configuration through ConfigMaps
- Secrets management through Kubernetes secrets
- Environment-specific GitLab URL configuration

**4. Production Ready:**
- Proper error handling and logging
- Pagination support for large datasets
- Request/response interceptors for monitoring

## Deployment on AKS:

**1. Create Kubernetes Resources:**
```bash
# Create the ConfigMap and Secret
kubectl apply -f gitlab-config.yaml

# Create base64 encoded token
echo -n "your-gitlab-token" | base64
```

**2. Environment Variables Priority:**
1. `GITLAB_TOKEN` (runtime environment)
2. `REACT_APP_GITLAB_TOKEN` (build-time)
3. `/etc/secrets/gitlab-token` (Kubernetes secret mount)

**3. Docker Build:**
```bash
docker build -t your-registry/react-app:latest .
docker push your-registry/react-app:latest
```

**4. AKS Deployment:**
The provided Kubernetes manifest includes:
- ConfigMap for GitLab configuration
- Secret for GitLab personal access token
- Deployment with proper volume mounts
- Multi-replica setup for high availability

## Key Features:

- **Health Monitoring:** Built-in health check for GitLab connectivity
- **Error Handling:** Comprehensive error handling with retry logic
- **Scalability:** Pagination support for large datasets
- **Security:** Token stored in Kubernetes secrets
- **Monitoring:** Request/response interceptors for observability

This implementation assumes your AAD authentication is already handled at the application level and focuses on robust GitLab integration that works well in AKS environments.
